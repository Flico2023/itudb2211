22/11/2022 I created the repo. I have attached the server.py file.
I added the layout.html and index.html pages for the home page. 
I am responsible for Attack, attemp and teams tables.
I made the frontend part of the pages about viewing these three tables and adding data. 
After connecting with the database, I will also implement the edit and delete functions. 

In summary, I did the frontend work that I needed to do.

10/12/2022 I added python/flask codes, new templates for editing data and edit some page templates. My code part of the project is finished. We need to make adjustments to the database file and related. After that, the project will be completely finished.
